# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Dana would like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, they should be able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

The purpose of this project is to help Dana to implement those features.

## Results
Using the webpage is very simple and easy, on the lefthand side the following filters are located:-
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

Users can easily filter according to their criteria, they just input the information into their respective fields and hit enter. The results will show up on the righthand side of the webpage, all the information will be organised in their respective columns.

## Summary
One drawback is that the filter can only look at one city at a time. For example, if someone types El Cajon they cannot serch for other cities at the same time.

Two recommendations for this project can be:-
* A sort function can be implemented (For example, dates can be sorted in ascending or descending order).
* A range function can be added (If a user wants to search specific date ranges like if someone only wants to see dates ranging from Jan to March of a certain year).
